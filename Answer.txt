What are the potential stages that can be added into CI process and for what purposes?

Pet-clinc unit testing and integration testing are already done in the build stage.
I thinks Current CI process lack of security check and feedback loop so I came up with two more stages that can be added into the process.

1. Dependency Scanning
Automatically scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check. 
This helps ensure that the libraries and frameworks your project relies on do not introduce security risks.

2. Quality Gates (Jenkins, Sonarqube and Jira)
The code is evaluated against the predefined criteria using tools integrated into the CI pipeline, such as SonarQube for code quality and security checks.
When Jenkins detects issues that cause a Quality Gate failure, it can automatically create tickets/issues in Jira. These Jira tickets can then be assigned to developers for resolution.
